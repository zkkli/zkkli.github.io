I am currently an assistant professor at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2025, advised by Prof. [Qingyi Gu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0046676). 
During my Ph.D. journey, I was awarded CAS Presidential Scholarship and National Scholarship.
I was a visiting scholar at the National University of Singapore (2024-2025), advised by Prof. [Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/).
I was also a visiting PhD student (remotely) at UC Berkeley (2023-2024), advised by Prof. [Zhen Dong](https://dong-zhen.com/) and Prof. [Kurt Keutzer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ID9QePIAAAAJ), and am very fortunate to maintain collaboration until now. I received my bachelor's degree from Dalian University of Technology in 2020.

My research interests include efficient AI (LLM, VLM, VideoGen), model compression, hardware-software co-design, and efficient evaluation and alignment. Our goal is to achieve efficient training (fine-tuning) and inference of models at low cost, low latency, and low power consumption through algorithmic and hardware optimization. 

ðŸ”¥***Long-term Recruiting: I am actively looking for visiting students and researchers (bachelor, master, or Ph.D.), feel free to contact me at zhikai.li@ia.ac.cn if you are interested in working with me!***
